# 🎉 Intended Use

**This project was built for:**

- Watch parties
- Game nights
- Themed events
- Social, in-person fun

**It prioritizes:**

- Low friction
- Clear UI
- Fast setup
- Zero accounts or installs

# ✍️ Why I Built This

- I wanted a trivia game that:
- Didn’t feel generic
- Actually worked on iPhones
- Could scale from 2 people to a full room
- Balanced structure with chaos

**This project combines front-end fundamentals, UX thinking, and real-world constraints (mobile audio, touch interaction, group flow) into something people genuinely enjoy using.**
